## Dmitry Shkolnik

Data Scientist at [Destination Canada](https://www.destinationcanada.com/en) where I specialize in analysis and modelling to better understand the behaviour of international visitors to Canada. Sometimes I get to make pretty things too. 

I try to support [open-source](https://github.com/dshkol) and open data where possible. I enjoy learning and using new tools whenever the opportunity presents itself, but I work primarily in R. In fact, this entire website was constructed in Rmarkdown using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and Hugo. 

If you wish to get in touch with me, please use any of links at the top of this page to find me on social media or just to email me directly. 

Vancouver, BC, Canada
