I am fascinated by cities, the data artifacts they produce, and the stories that those artifacts tell us. I live in San Francisco, grew up in Vancouver, and had stints in Singapore (longer) and Copenhagen (shorter) in between. I work in the data science team at Instacart where I lead a team that looks to better understand the nuances of balancing supply and demand. Previously I did roughly the same thing but in South East Asia, and before that I was doing something completely different building geospatial models of tourist activity for the federal government of Canada. 

I started this blog in 2017 with three goals in mind. First, I wanted to push and develop my skills with R and data visualization by answering questions that were actually interesting to me rather than rehashing the same tired datasets and problems I was seeing online. Second, I thought it would be a good way of tackling my insecurity about being self-taught and being outside of the mainstream tech industry (at the time). Third, I wanted to promote the open-source projects I was collaborating on with demos and tutorials. I think that this project was successful at addressing all three objectives; however, this also resulted in me having less time and less motivation to keep going at the same rate over time, which is probably obvious from the post dates.  

I try to support [open-source projects](https://github.com/dshkol) and open data where possible. I'm the co-creator of the [cancensus](https://mountainmath.github.io/cancensus/index.html) and [cansim](https://mountainmath.github.io/cansim/index.html) packages. Many of the posts on this page that relate to Canadian data use one or both of these packages, which I likely to shamelessly promote. I also made the [airportr package](https://github.com/dshkol/airportr). 

This entire website was constructed in Rmarkdown using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and Hugo.
